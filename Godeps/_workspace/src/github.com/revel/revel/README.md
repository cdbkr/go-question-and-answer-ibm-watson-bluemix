### Apology and Thanks

The Revel team has lagged behind on our ideal release cycle of every 6 weeks. I know Revel is an open
source project developed by volunteers, but I wanted to apologize for the delay. I also want to publicly
acknowledge my gratitude for @pushrax's hard work in assisting me in this release as well as @verdverm,
@landr0id and other active community members in helping us fix bugs and further enhance Revel's features.

Thank you!

### v1.0 Goal

This still remains our goal. We are actively working on improving the learning curve for Revel as
well as enhancing the work flow for Revel-based apps.

You'll notice that our next planned milestone release is v0.10 and you may wonder if Revel is
production-ready. The short answer is yes. However, the team feels that there are still some
features needed before we can make a whole-hearted endorsement of Revel as a true "batteries-included" web framework.

For those of you new to Go or Revel, we'd like to invite you to join us on our march to v1.0
and help make Revel a stable, secure and enjoyable web framework.

We'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire community for their feedback and
regular contributions. Your support has been very encouraging and highly appreciated.
